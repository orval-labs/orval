Orval generates type-safe JS clients (TypeScript) from any valid OpenAPI v3 or Swagger v2 specification, either in yaml or json formats.

## Motivation

Developers often use swagger as a contract between the frontend and backend. Before Orval, tools such as <a href="https://editor.swagger.io" target="_blank">Swagger Editor</a> or <a href="https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen" target="_blank">Swagger Codegen</a> did the job. But that is not enough for modern development needs. Enter Orval.

Main goals:

- Generate TypeScript models
- Generate HTTP request functions
- Generate mocks with <a href="https://mswjs.io/" target="_blank">MSW</a>

The default generated clients use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API" target="_blank">Fetch API</a>. You may configure any client(e.g. axios), depending on your project needs. Orval supports most major JavaScript frameworks such as Angular, React or Vue.

Orval can also generate the following clients:

- [React query with Axios](./guides/react-query)
- [Angular with HttpClient](./guides/angular)
