title: Migration Guide to v8
---

This guide explains the changes required to migrate from Orval v7 to v8.

## 1. Changed default value of httpClient from `axios` to `fetch`

We changed the default httpClient from `axios` to `fetch` to reduce bundle size and eliminate the need for additional dependencies.

### How to maintain compatibility

If you want to keep using axios, configure it as follows:

```diff:orval.config.ts
export default {
  petstore: {
    output: {
+     httpClient: 'axios', // Explicitly specify
      target: './src/api',
    },
    input: {
      target: './petstore.yaml',
    },
  },
};
```

## 2. Removed `override.fetch.explode` option

This parameter was kept only for compatibility. Since compatibility maintenance is no longer needed in major versions, it has been removed.

### How to maintain compatibility

Specify `explode` directly in the OpenAPI specification file.

```diff:petstore.yaml
paths:
  /pets:
    get:
      parameters:
        - name: tags
          in: query
+         explode: true
          schema:
            type: array
```

## 3. Changed default value of `override.mock.delay` from `1000` to `false`

We disabled the default delay as it creates noise.

### How to maintain compatibility

If you want to explicitly set a delay, specify it in milliseconds.

```diff:orval.config.ts
export default {
  petstore: {
    output: {
      mock: {
+       delay: 1000, // In milliseconds
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## 4. Removed `override.coerceTypes`

This was removed as it has been replaced by the more flexible and explicit `override.zod.coerce`.

### How to maintain compatibility

Use `override.zod.coerce`.

```diff:orval.config.ts
export default {
  petstore: {
    output: {
      override: {
-       coerceTypes: true
+       zod: {
+         coerce: {
+           param: true,
+           query: true,
+           header: true,
+           body: true,
+           response: true
+         }
+       }
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## 5. Removed `override.useNativeEnums`

This was removed as it has been integrated into `enumGenerationType`.

### How to maintain compatibility

Use `enumGenerationType`.

```diff:orval.config.ts
export default {
  petstore: {
    output: {
      override: {
-       useNativeEnums: true
+       enumGenerationType: 'enum'
      },
    },
  },
};
```
